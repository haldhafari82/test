ok.. i obviously don't understand it intuitively. many others finish it in first try with higher percentage. 
i need to stop looking at test and understand the theory.. what am i missing?
i'll start with the suggested book. once done.. i need to do multiple tests:
my goal should be 100%, not 85!
don't read it for the test.. read it as a project lead.
this topic can be used in governance or any other field as well..
it's a how-to to get productive.
0) read book. Ok.
1) re-read guide.
2) open assessment.. summarize. some questions are dead on. do until i can complete them in under 10 mins. Ok.
3) developer open assessment. Ok.
4) PO open assessment. Ok.
5) http://mlapshin.com Need 100%. Repeat as often as necessary.
6) Book tests.
6) https://quizlet.com/153587954/sk-flash-cards/
7) http://www.scrummastercorner.com/practice-now/

on day of exam.. go through ALL tests in sequence. for the book tests.. if there are many i should probably do only the ones i've usually failed.

estimate questions..
do developer test.
do product owner test.

is a sprint an "event"?
-------------

when time permits.. read Agile Manifesto.

product owner .. manages communication with stakeholders (customers, users, management).
scrum master .. manages communication inside organization completing work. so.. bureaucracy is his work.
one product.. one backlog, one product owner even if there are multiple scrum teams.
stakeholders can communicate with developers.
no sprint 0.
Who is responsible for managing the progress of work during a Sprint? development team.

Purpose of Scrum Guide:
* Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.

Definition of Scrum:
* A framework to address complex adaptive problems while delivering products of highest possible value.
* Scrum is 
  - lightweight
  - simple to understand
  - difficult to master
* scrum consists of scrum teams, roles, events, artifacts, and rules.

Scrum Theory:
* Scrum founded on empirical process control theory
* Empiricism - knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
* Empiricism built on three "pillars": Transparency, inspection and adaptation.
   > Transparency:
     * Aspects of process visible to those responsible for outcome.
     * Aspects defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.

   > Inspection:
     * Scrum users must frequently inspect artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal.
     * Inspections most beneficial when performed by skilled inspectors.

   > Adaptation:
     * If inspection finds deviation, adjustments are required.
     * Adjustments needed ASAP to minimize further deviation.
     * Inspection + Adaptation implemented by "Scrum Events":
       - Sprint Planning
       - Daily Scrum
       - Sprint Review
       - Spring Retrospective
	
* Pillars come to life when the following values are embodied by Scrum Team:   
    Values:
       Commitment: commit to achieving goals.
	   Courage: courage to do right thing and work on tough problems.
	   Focus: focus on sprint and goals.
	   Openness: open about work and challenges.
	   Respect: respect each others.
	   
Scrum Team:
* Self Organizing: choose internally how to accomplish their work. Not directed from outside.
  Cross-functional: contains all competencies required, no reliance on others.
* Designed to optimize flexibility, creativity and productivity.
* Deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.
* Incremental deliveries of "Done" ensure a useful version is always available.

  > Product Owner
     * Characteristics:
       Product Value Maximizer
       Lead Facilitator of Key Stakeholder Involvement
       Product Marketplace Expert	 
     * Responsible for maximizing value of product and work of Development team.
	 * Sole person responsible for managing backlog (Product Management):
	    > Clearly express Product Backlog items.
		> Ordering items in Product Backlog.
		> Ensure Backlog transparency.
		> Optimizing value of Development Team.
		> Ensure Development Team understands Backlog.
     * Can delegate some tasks to Dev team. However, product owner is always accountable.
	 * Only individual who gives instructions to Development Team.
	 * Sprint Backlog: The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them. 
	
  > Development Team
    * Only members who create the "Increment".
	> Self-Organizing
	> Cross-functional
	> No titles
	> No sub-teams
	> Accountability belongs to team
	> Size: 3 to 9
	> Development Teams responsible for all estimates.
  
  > Scrum Master
    * Ensure scrum is enacted by adhering to theory, practices and rules.
	* Interacts with others outside of Scrum Team.
	Services to Product Owner:
	  > Finding techniques for effective product management
	  > Help team understand need for clear and concise backlog items
	  > Understand product planning
	  > Ensure product owner knows how to arrange Product Backlog.
	  > Understand/Practice Agility
	  > Facilitate Scrum events as requested/needed.
	Services to Development Team:
      > Coach Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
      > Help team create high-value products
      > Remove impediments
      > facilitate scrum events as requested/needed
      > coach team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

Scrum Events:
  * Prescribed events used to create regularity and minimize need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
  * Time-boxed
  * each event is an opportunity to inspect and adapt.
  * designed to enable transparency and inspection.
  
  > Sprint
    * Heart of Scrum
	* One month or less to create a "Done", usable, releasable product Increment is created.
    * Container for other events
    * Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed (can't shorten or lengthen). Other events can be shortened or lengthened as long as they're in the time-box.
	* Starts right after previous Sprint is complete.
	* Scope maybe re-clarified during Sprint.
	* Enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward Sprint Goal.
	* Limit risk to one calendar month of cost.
	* Can only be canceled by Product Owner. Might release some work. Remaining sent back to backlog.
	
   Events:: (all are opportunities to inspect and adapt!)
	
    Planning:
       * 8 hours max.
	   * Input:
	      > Product Backlog
		  > Latest product Increment
		  > Projected Capacity of Development Team
		  > Past performance of Development Team
       * Session used to answer:
            What can be delivered?
			  Only development team can access how much work can be completed.
			  Team crafts a "Sprint Goal" from the Product Backlog that can be delivered in the Sprint.
			  Goal provided guidance to Development team on why it's building the Increment.
            How will work needed be achieved to deliver Increment?
			  Development team designs the system and work needed to convert the "Product Backlog" to a "Product Increment".
			  Development team may invite others to team.
			  By end of Sprint Planning, the development team should be able to explain how it intends to accomplish Sprint Goal.
	  * Sprint Goal:
        - An objective set for that can be met through implementation of Product Backlog.
        - Provides guidance for developers on why it is building the Increment.
        - Coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
		- Created by Scrum Team.

    Daily Scrum:
       * 15 mins for Dev Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
       * Dev Team members explain:
          What I did yesterday.
          What I'm doing today.
		  Impediments.
	   * Scrum Master ensures meetings happen.
       * Only Dev Team members participate in Daily Scrum.
       * Improves communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve team's level of knowledge. Key for inspect and adapt.	   
	
    Sprint Review:
	   * 4 hour time-box.
       * Held at end of Sprint to inspect Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
       * Scrum Team + stakeholders discuss what was done this sprint.
       * Informal meeting. Not a status meeting.
       * Present the Increment to get feedback and foster collaboration.
       
	   Purpose:
       > Product Owner invites Scrum Team and stakeholders
       > Product Owner which Product Backlog items have been done and which haven't.
       > Development Team discusses what went well and what didn't.
       > Development Team presents work that was "Done".
       > Review time-lines, budgets, etc.	  

    Sprint Retrospective:
	   * 3 Hour time-box.
	   * attended by Scrum Team (including Scrum Master).
       * Scrum Team inspects itself and create a plan for improvements during next Sprint.
       * Happens after SPrint Review and prior to next Sprint Planning.
       * Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the definition of "Done" as appropriate.
       * Retro provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.
	   * Scrum Team identifies improvements to implement in next Sprint. No set time to complete improvements.
	   
       Purpose:
       > Inspect how last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process and tools.
       > Identify and order major items that went well and potential improvements.
       > Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

Scrum Artifacts:
  * Represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
  * Designed to maximize transparency so that everyone has the same understanding of the artifact.
  * Scrum Master works with Scrum Team to increase transparency of the artifacts.
  
    Product Backlog:
	  * Ordered list of everything needed.
	  * Never complete.
	  * Product Backlog refinement: adding detail, estimates, and order to items in Backlog. Done by PO and Dev.
	  * Refinement consumes less than 10% of Dev Team Capacity.
	  * Higher ordered items are usually clearer and more detailed.
	  * Dev team responsible for all estimates.
	  * Product Owner monitors progress toward a goal. PO compares remaining work with previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by desired time for goal.
	  * PO makes progress transparent to all stakeholders.
	  
	Sprint Backlog:
	  * Set of Product Backlog items selected for Sprint + plan for delivering product Increment and realizing Sprint Goal.
	  * Sprint Backlog is a forecast by Dev Team about what functionality will be in next Increment and work needed to deliver functionality into a "Done" Increment.
	  * Dev Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint.
	  * Only Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during Sprint.
	  * Dev Team adds new work and removes work from Sprint Backlog as needed.
	
	Increment:
	  * Increment = Sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint + the value of increments of all previous Sprints.
	                 (Open Enhancements, Defects) + (Completed Enhancements, Defects)
	  * Increment must be done by end of Sprint regardless of whether Product Owner decides to release it.
	  * Created by development team.

Definition of Done:
* As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality.
  - DoD is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
  - DoD guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning
  - DoD ensures artifact transparency
* Definition of Done is responsibility to Development Team.  
  
* Cone of Uncertainty:
- At the beginning of any project we don’t know exactly how long a project is going to take.  
- Make the promise closer to the end.. 
- "How much is known about the Product over time"
- The Cone of Uncertainty describes the evolution of the amount of uncertainty during a project.

* Burndown chart:
- A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time (for the sprint). 
----------------

1) You must implement new functionality in every sprint. You can't just remove technical debt..
2) Who creates the increment? Development Team alone.
3) Who is responsible for promoting and supporting scrum? Scrum Master
4) There is no set structure for daily scrum.. answering the 3 questions isn't necessary.
5) Sprint Retro purpose
6) Product Owner should be a "Product Marketplace Expert"
7) Scrum team model designed to optimize Productivity, Flexibility, Creativity
8) Scrum recommends using only those Scrum components and rules which suit most for a particular project. False. 
9) Sprint Planning input.
10) Product Backlog Management
11) Scrum Teams working on same product do not have to have same Sprint length.
12) Scrum allows additional meetings.
13) Stakeholders not allowed to Sprint Planning.
